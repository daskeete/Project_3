# Project_3

Selected Country: Cameroon

I chose to work with Cameroon because it's the same country that i used in project 2 where we used demographic and housing data to predict wealth outcomes. 
Cameroon is a relatively large country in Central Africa and it is home to approximately 25.88 million people. Below is a population density map of Cameroon and it shows that most of the population is situated in the northern half of the country. Interestingly not a lot of people like to live on the coast. About 20% of the land is used for agriculture and 41% of the land is covered by forests. Most of this farm and forest land is located in the southern part of the country which explains why the population is concentrated in the northern half of the region.


### delete - if model could be adjusted in a way that would allow for agri land to be ignored??
